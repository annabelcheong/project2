       "lore the potential of art to heal and care for fragile natural and social ecosystems. In considering our relationship to sentient Country, as both a concept and lived experience, these works engender an attentiveness in and about the world.\\\\n\\\\nThe National 2021: New Australian Art is a celebration of contemporary Australian art. The third in a series of biennial survey exhibitions, it showcases work being made across the country by artists of different generations and cultural backgrounds. Through ambitious new and commissioned projects, the 39 artists, collectives and collaboratives featured across three venues respond to the times in which they live, presenting observations that are provocative, political and poetic. The Nationa 2021 is a partnership between the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), Carriageworks and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA).\\\\n\\\\nThis year, it has been curated by Matt Cox and Erin Vink (AGNSW), Abigail Moncrieff (Carriageworks), and Rachel Kent (MCA). Working in close dialogue, they have developed three distinct presentations of new Australian art that together highlight many of the ideas and concerns motivating artists in Australia today.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information visit the dedicated website.\",\\n        \"category\": \"expos\",\\n        \"start_date\": 1626217200000,\\n        \"end_date\": 1626260400000,\\n        \"country\": \"AU\",\\n        \"coords\": \"{151.214894,-33.871516}\",\\n        \"rank\": 45,\\n        \"venue_name\": \"no venue\",\\n        \"formatted_address\": \"no address\"\\n    },\\n    \"1482\": {\\n        \"id\": \"qByJPeWpukZMnxL7yd\",\\n        \"title\": \"The Polished Opal\",\\n        \"description\": \"The workshop starts with a short talk about opals with examples to look at and handle. Then you get to choose a parcel of three opals per person, ranging in size from six-twelve carats. You then learn how to polish them and release the gorgeous fire within the stones, which takes approximately two hours for all three stones. \\\\n\\\\nThis gives people the unique experience of polishing genuine Australian opal. There is nowhere else where you can polish opals and it is very likely that the opals you leave with will be worth more than the money you spent on this workshop. In fact, potentially you could polish an opal that is worth hundreds of dollars as it is impossible to see what an opal will look like before it\\'s been polished, truly the luck of the draw. \\\\n\\\\nBut this workshop gives you the information to help you make an informed choice of the parcel of opals you\\'ll choose.When the opals have been polished, they are placed in a small display case for you to take home or, alternatively, they can be set in a piece of jewellery either on site or by your own jeweller back home.\",\\n        \"category\": \"community\",\\n        \"start_date\": 1626217200000,\\n        \"end_date\": 1626228000000,\\n        \"country\": \"AU\",\\n        \"coords\": \"{150.333328,-33.702448}\",\\n        \"rank\": 0,\\n        \"venue_name\": \"no venue\",\\n        \"formatted_address\": \"no address\"\\n    },\\n    \"1483\": {\\n        \"id\": \"w54zgbJwaUwNNPLra4\",\\n        \"title\": \"Flower Crown Group Class\",\\n        \"description\": \"Have a special event coming up?

The third in a series of biennial survey exhibitions, it showcases work being made across the country by artists of different generations and cultural backgrounds. Through ambitious new and commissioned projects, the 39 artists, collectives and collaboratives featured across three venues respond to the times in which they live, presenting observations that are provocative, political and poetic. The Nationa 2021 is a partnership between the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), Carriageworks and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA).\\n\\nThis year, it has been curated by Matt Cox and Erin Vink (AGNSW), Abigail Moncrieff (Carriageworks), and Rachel Kent (MCA). Working in close dialogue, they have developed three distinct presentations of new Australian art that together highlight many of the ideas and concerns motivating artists in Australia today.\\n\\nFor more information visit the dedicated website.\",\n        \"category\": \"expos\",\n        \"start_date\": 1626217200000,\n        \"end_date\": 1626260400000,\n        \"country\": \"AU\",\n        \"coords\": \"{151.214894,-33.871516}\",\n        \"rank\": 45,\n        \"venue_name\": \"no venue\",\n        \"formatted_address\": \"no address\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"qByJPeWpukZMnxL7yd\",\n        \"title\": \"The Polished Opal\",\n        \"description\": \"The workshop starts with a short talk about opals with examples to look at and handle.

You then learn how to polish them and release the gorgeous fire within the stones, which takes approximately two hours for all three stones. \\n\\nThis gives people the unique experience of polishing genuine Australian opal. There is nowhere else where you can polish opals and it is very likely that the opals you leave with will be worth more than the money you spent on this workshop. In fact, potentially you could polish an opal that is worth hundreds of dollars as it is impossible to see what an opal will look like before it's been polished, truly the luck of the draw. \\n\\nBut this workshop gives you the information to help you make an informed choice of the parcel of opals you'll choose.When the opals have been polished, they are placed in a small display case for you to take home or, alternatively, they can be set in a piece of jewellery either on site or by your own jeweller back home.\",\n        \"category\": \"community\",\n        \"start_date\": 1626217200000,\n        \"end_date\": 1626228000000,\n        \"country\": \"AU\",\n        \"coords\": \"{150.333328,-33.702448}\",\n        \"rank\": 0,\n        \"venue_name\": \"no venue\",\n        \"formatted_address\": \"no address\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"w54zgbJwaUwNNPLra4\",\n        \"title\": \"Flower Crown Group Class\",\n        \"description\": \"Have a special event coming up?
