Through ambitious new and commissioned projects, the 39 artists, collectives and collaboratives featured across three venues respond to the times in which they live, presenting observations that are provocative, political and poetic. The Nationa 2021 is a partnership between the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW), Carriageworks and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA).\\n\\nThis year, it has been curated by Matt Cox and Erin Vink (AGNSW), Abigail Moncrieff (Carriageworks), and Rachel Kent (MCA). Working in close dialogue, they have developed three distinct presentations of new Australian art that together highlight many of the ideas and concerns motivating artists in Australia today.\\n\\nFor more information visit the dedicated website.\",\n            \"duration\": 28800,\n            \"end\": \"2021-07-25T07:00:00Z\",\n            \"entities\": [\n                {\n                    \"category\": \"expos\",\n                    \"entity_id\": \"wPKfn8xvSMJrkncmGpKqkp\",\n                    \"labels\": [\n                        \"event-group\",\n                        \"expo\",\n                        \"recurring\"\n                    ],\n                    \"name\": \"The National 2021 at AGNSW\",\n                    \"type\": \"event-group\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"first_seen\": \"2021-04-23T06:40:28Z\",\n            \"id\": \"Bxp5EQkYsgQv9cD2Uy\",\n            \"labels\": [\n                \"expo\"\n            ],\n            \"local_rank\": 52,\n            \"location\": [\n                151.214894,\n                -33.871516\n            ],\n            \"phq_attendance\": 562,\n            \"place_hierarchies\": [\n                [\n                    \"6295630\",\n                    \"6255151\",\n                    \"2077456\",\n                    \"2155400\",\n                    \"6619279\",\n                    \"2147714\"\n                ]\n            ],\n            \"private\": false,\n            \"rank\": 45,\n            \"relevance\": 1.0,\n            \"scope\": \"locality\",\n            \"start\": \"2021-07-24T23:00:00Z\",\n            \"state\": \"active\",\n            \"timezone\": \"Australia/Sydney\",\n            \"title\": \"The National 2021 at AGNSW\",\n            \"updated\": \"2021-04-23T06:44:21Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"aviation_rank\": null,\n            \"brand_safe\": true,\n            \"category\": \"expos\",\n            \"country\": \"AU\",\n            \"description\": \"Experience one of the largest stock selling centres in New South Wales.\\nGunnedah Saleyards is located on the edge of town, just a kilometre from the town centre on the Kamilaroi highway towards Narrabri.\\n\\nCattle Stock sales are held every Tuesday, with all cattle sold live weight.\\n\\nSaleyards auctions are proceeding as usual, however non-essential personnel are asked not to attend in order to maintain safety standards.\",\n            \"duration\": 7200,\n            \"end\": \"2021-07-25T01:00:00Z\",\n            \"entities\": [\n                {\n                    \"category\": \"expos\",\n                    \"entity_id\": \"7YcCaPcvZ7ANVcuYkgvJLv\",\n                    \"labels\": [\n                        \"event-group\",\n                        \"expo\",\n                        \"recurring\"\n                    ],\n                    \"name\": \"Gunnedah Saleyards\",\n                    \"type\": \"event-group\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"first_seen\": \"2021-04-13T06:35:04Z\",\n            \"id\": \"CAZ3ug7jKFWWK5cmKU\",\n            \"labels\": [\n                \"expo\"\n            ],\n            \"local_rank\": 73,\n            \"location\": [\n                150.224511,\n                -30.958274\n            ],\n            \"phq_attendance\": 562,\n            \"place_hierarchies\": [\n                [\n                    \"6295630\",\n                    \"6255151\",\n                    \"2077456\",\n                    \"2155400\",\n                    \"7839725\",\n                    \"2164205\"\n                ]\n            ],\n            \"private\": false,\n            \"rank\": 45,\n            \"relevance\": 1.0,\n            \"scope\": \"locality\",\n            \"start\": \"2021-07-24T23:00:00Z\",\n            \"state\": \"active\",\n            \"timezone\": \"Australia/Sydney\",\n            \"title\": \"Gunnedah Saleyards\",\n            \"updated\": \"2021-04-13T07:52:26Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"aviation_rank\": null,\n            \"brand_safe\": true,\n            \"category\": \"community\",\n            \"country\": \"AU\",\n            \"description\": \"Unique Boutique Markets are hosting monthly markets in the beautiful town of Marulan held on the last Sunday of each month (except December) in the carpark of the Marulan Village Centre!\\nCome along and support local small home-based businesses and find that special one-of-a-kind item for yourself or a loved one.\\n\\nIt's the perfect place to browse while you discover the talents and handmade products of our stallholders.
