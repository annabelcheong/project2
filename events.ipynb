There is nowhere else where you can polish opals and it is very likely that the opals you leave with will be worth more than the money you spent on this workshop. In fact, potentially you could polish an opal that is worth hundreds of dollars as it is impossible to see what an opal will look like before it's been polished, truly the luck of the draw. \\n\\nBut this workshop gives you the information to help you make an informed choice of the parcel of opals you'll choose.When the opals have been polished, they are placed in a small display case for you to take home or, alternatively, they can be set in a piece of jewellery either on site or by your own jeweller back home.\",\n            \"duration\": 10800,\n            \"end\": \"2021-07-21T02:00:00Z\",\n            \"entities\": [\n                {\n                    \"category\": \"community\",\n                    \"entity_id\": \"WyuSXvLNHDDBxnVAUuwKbE\",\n                    \"labels\": [\n                        \"community\",\n                        \"event-group\",\n                        \"recurring\"\n                    ],\n                    \"name\": \"The Polished Opal\",\n                    \"type\": \"event-group\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"first_seen\": \"2019-12-09T07:03:51Z\",\n            \"id\": \"EJqNn748zA5y6wMUQq\",\n            \"labels\": [\n                \"community\"\n            ],\n            \"local_rank\": 0,\n            \"location\": [\n                150.333328,\n                -33.702448\n            ],\n            \"phq_attendance\": null,\n            \"place_hierarchies\": [\n                [\n                    \"6295630\",\n                    \"6255151\",\n                    \"2077456\",\n                    \"2155400\",\n                    \"2175228\",\n                    \"2161776\"\n                ],\n                [\n                    \"6295630\",\n                    \"6255151\",\n                    \"2077456\",\n                    \"2155400\",\n                    \"2175228\",\n                    \"2160297\"\n                ]\n            ],\n            \"private\": false,\n            \"rank\": 0,\n            \"relevance\": 1.0,\n            \"scope\": \"locality\",\n            \"start\": \"2021-07-20T23:00:00Z\",\n            \"state\": \"active\",\n            \"timezone\": \"Australia/Sydney\",\n            \"title\": \"The Polished Opal\",\n            \"updated\": \"2020-07-02T23:02:56Z\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"aviation_rank\": null,\n            \"brand_safe\": true,\n            \"category\": \"expos\",\n            \"country\": \"AU\",\n            \"description\": \"Truth, Power and a Free press is a compelling exhibition that explores the relationship between trusted media sources and a healthy democracy.\\n\\nIconic objects from Australia\\u2019s media history are brought together for the first time including the printing press used by the Father of Federation, Sir Henry Parkes, Peter Greste\\u2019s letters smuggled to his family from an Egyptian prison and the protective body armour vest worn by war photographer, Neil Davis.\\n\\nThrough an immersive seven-foot-tall audiovisual display, some of Australia\\u2019s most respected journalists share their personal stories for the battle for truth.

Then you get to choose a parcel of three opals per person, ranging in size from six-twelve carats. You then learn how to polish them and release the gorgeous fire within the stones, which takes approximately two hours for all three stones. \\n\\nThis gives people the unique experience of polishing genuine Australian opal. There is nowhere else where you can polish opals and it is very likely that the opals you leave with will be worth more than the money you spent on this workshop. In fact, potentially you could polish an opal that is worth hundreds of dollars as it is impossible to see what an opal will look like before it's been polished, truly the luck of the draw. \\n\\nBut this workshop gives you the information to help you make an informed choice of the parcel of opals you'll choose.When the opals have been polished, they are placed in a small display case for you to take home or, alternatively, they can be set in a piece of jewellery either on site or by your own jeweller back home.\",\n        \"duration\": 10800,\n        \"end\": \"2021-07-21T02:00:00Z\",\n        \"entities\": [\n            {\n                \"category\": \"community\",\n                \"entity_id\": \"WyuSXvLNHDDBxnVAUuwKbE\",\n                \"labels\": [\n                    \"community\",\n                    \"event-group\",\n                    \"recurring\"\n                ],\n                \"name\": \"The Polished Opal\",\n                \"type\": \"event-group\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"first_seen\": \"2019-12-09T07:03:51Z\",\n        \"id\": \"EJqNn748zA5y6wMUQq\",\n        \"labels\": [\n            \"community\"\n        ],\n        \"local_rank\": 0,\n        \"location\": [\n            150.333328,\n            -33.702448\n        ],\n        \"phq_attendance\": null,\n        \"place_hierarchies\": [\n            [\n                \"6295630\",\n                \"6255151\",\n                \"2077456\",\n                \"2155400\",\n                \"2175228\",\n                \"2161776\"\n            ],\n            [\n                \"6295630\",\n                \"6255151\",\n                \"2077456\",\n                \"2155400\",\n                \"2175228\",\n                \"2160297\"\n            ]\n        ],\n        \"private\": false,\n        \"rank\": 0,\n        \"relevance\": 1.0,\n        \"scope\": \"locality\",\n        \"start\": \"2021-07-20T23:00:00Z\",\n        \"state\": \"active\",\n        \"timezone\": \"Australia/Sydney\",\n        \"title\": \"The Polished Opal\",\n        \"updated\": \"2020-07-02T23:02:56Z\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"aviation_rank\": null,\n        \"brand_safe\": true,\n        \"category\": \"expos\",\n        \"country\": \"AU\",\n        \"description\": \"Truth, Power and a Free press is a compelling exhibition that explores the relationship between trusted media sources and a healthy democracy.\\n\\nIconic objects from Australia\\u2019s media history are brought together for the first time including the printing press used by the Father of Federation, Sir Henry Parkes, Peter Greste\\u2019s letters smuggled to his family from an Egyptian prison and the protective body armour vest worn by war photographer, Neil Davis.\\n\\nThrough an immersive seven-foot-tall audiovisual display, some of Australia\\u2019s most respected journalists share their personal stories for the battle for truth.
